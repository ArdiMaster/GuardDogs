GuardDogs is a Bukkit plugin which allows you to create guard dogs which will attack players coming near them.
This plugin is still under heavy development.

Credits to ArchmageInc for the original idea (https://github.com/ArchmageInc/GuardDog). I also reused some of his original code.

The plugin is distributed under the terms and contitions of the "3-clause" BSD license.
